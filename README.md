# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a new version of Tic-Tac-Toe! Where you have the ability to sign-up and
sign-in to the game. This allows you to keep track of every win you get and see
them when you return!!! [visit the site right here!!](https://gastevend.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client/)

## Dependencies
Technologies that were used include BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TOO:
HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, AJAX, JQuery, and GA Tic-Tac-Toe API.


## Project Planning
I started out with some wire frames that can be seen [here] (https://github.com/gastevend/wireframes).
I then started out by writing some user stories that I could follow along with
step by step in order to keep by game on track. Can be found [here] (https://github.com/gastevend/wireframes/blob/master/User%20Stories)
I started with just simply making the board render in the browser so I had
somewhere to start. Next, I then wrote the game logic. Just a note.. something
I would have done differently in planning would be to set up my api first to get
that up and running then moved on to my game logic from there. I think it would
have been cleaner code if I did that. I wrote my game logic based on the html
on the page and if I looked at the API I probably would have wrote the game
logic based off of the request and response format so that it would be easier
to handle the responses from the API. Then I moved to setting up my API and got
that working. Then with what time I had left I tried to make the UI not as
crappy as it was in order to make it just a little it more user friendly.

Another side note for the API work. I think this what the hardest thing for me
to wrap my head around. I actually wish i went back more to the trainings we did
in class and referneced those more instead of being stubborn and wasting time and
trying to figure it out. I also learned the most valuable lesson of get it working
and refactor it later :).


## Future Releases.
1. Joining in on a game from a different device. (almost got this working... I have
the button to do so all set up and the API working to get the functionaity in
but by the time of project submission i diddnt have the button formatted the way
I wantted to and in some instances would be considered 'pointless' to be on the
page. So i played it safe and just got ride of it from the UI altogether to avoid
any untested bugs.)
2. A better UI. UI is very clunky. I get it. But I want to get a better version
out soon
3. Code refactoring.
4. Better authentication error handeling.
5. Better authentication process. More of a step by step hand hold.
